## game paly

# black jack:
 the game draws two cards for each player 
you want your card to add up to as close to 21 as possible.
if you do no reach 21 on the first 'round' with your first two cards you can 'hit' and get another card to add to the two you have.
if you go over 21 you lose automaticaly. 
the player closes to 21 wins.


*  the game will have a deck of cards 
this will be two arrays 
i will loop through these arrays at randome to get a card 

*  i will make two players 
these players will take turns till someone hits 21 or dosent want another card 

* i will write two functions to determan if the player will take another card or if they will stay with what they have. this will be done last after the game is working and is pulling cards

* who ever gets closet to 21 with out going over will win going over you auto lose.i will need to make another function to check who wins/when the game is over 

* i will make two buttons for the game so the player can decide to hit for another card of stay with what they have 

* i will need to make a function to assign value to the cards as well i believe
